My first year as a software engineer came to a close sometime in the middle of October, and I have take and little time to reflect on
some of the lessons I have learned over the past year. To be clear, this is more about the __meta__ of software engineering and not really
about the actual technologies learned. This will, hopefully, allow new computer science/IT/boot camp grads to have a leg up on the outside
world, as she is a cruel beast.
### A job is a trade of goods for services
You can think of goods as really anything that you are receiving in order to facilitate you spending 8 hours a day in a rolly chair in front
of a computer screen. The obvious one is the money, but there is also paid time off, health insurance, and 401k matching to name a few. There
are also the not so obvious ones such as learning opportunities, leadership opportunities, and work from home time. Services are the functions you render to the company that employs you. For software engineers this usually includes coding but can also include system administration, as well being on call 24/7.
