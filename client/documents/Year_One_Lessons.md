My first year as a software engineer came to a close sometime in the middle of October, and I have take and little time to reflect on
some of the lessons I have learned over the past year. To be clear, this is more about the __meta__ of software engineering and not really
about the actual technologies learned. This will, hopefully, allow new computer science/IT/boot camp grads to have a leg up on the outside
world, as she is a cruel beast.
### A job is a trade of goods for services
You can think of goods as really anything that you are receiving in order to facilitate you spending 8 hours a day in a rolly chair in front
of a computer screen. The obvious one is the money, but there is also paid time off, health insurance, and 401k matching to name a few. There
are also the not so obvious ones such as learning opportunities, leadership opportunities, and work from home time. Services are the functions you render to the company that employs you. For software engineers this usually includes coding but can also include system administration, as well being on call 24/7. Then there are yet other items that can fall under either categories such as commute to work, quality of work environment, and quality of coworkers and supervisors. Most of these are hidden until you have accepted the position and are already working. One may weight different goods and services as higher lower than others but that is completely up to the individual. However, at the end of the day you want to ensure that goods >= services.
### Learn how to sell yourself
No, not the street corner kind. This is knowing how to convey your being, in a positive light, to someone. This is your elevator pitch. This is the answer to the first question of most interviews, who are you, what do you do? Being able to nail this opens up a world of opportunities. Anyone you meet is a potential employer, and being able to spit out your passions, your body of work, and what your path forward is in a succinct but exciting way is a big foot in the door. If you can do this in an interview well enough a lot of times the next question will be when can you start or when can you come in for an in person?
### Recruiter's interests are not your own
Don't get me wrong. Recruiters can be swell people and do a lot of the dirty work that goes into finding a new opportunity. However, they are looking out for themselves not you. Which is fine as you should be looking out for you. Recruiters want to get paid which means they just want to place you into any position they see open for their clients. They try to match what they see on your resume to what they have open. They don't try to find what you want or what your dream job is. They just want to match you with an employer that has the highest chance of hiring you.
